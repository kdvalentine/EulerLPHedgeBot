? tighten up getLimits bounds

TESTING

* when exchange rate in vaults != 1
* better coverage of swaps done via hooks

IDEAS

* Currently we have only been supporting stable-stable pairs
  * What extra considerations would there be for floating pairs?
* Automatically re-invest fees? There are a few options:
  * Don't do anything: Re-deploying probably isn't a huge deal
  * Increase the reserves by the fee amount
  * Increase the reserves by the extra amount of possible leverage supported by the new fee
  * Apply fees to a super-concentrated middle section of the curve (needs R&D)
* Could current reserves be calculated dynamically based on balances/debts/debt limits?
  * I guess you would lose a chunk of interest to arbitrage
  * Donation attacks?
